        <p>If you're working in a strategic role at a digital-first company and you've ever been asked "What's driving their growth?" in a meeting...</p>
        <p>Then watched a colleague pull up exact traffic numbers, channel breakdowns, and trend data whilst you scrambled for something concrete to say...</p>
        <p>I'm about to show you how to become that person who always has the data - starting this Tuesday.</p>
        <p>In just 5 days, you'll master 28 specific tactical skills that let you reverse-engineer <strong>any company's</strong> digital strategy - whether that's your #1 competitor, a potential customer you want to win, the market leader in your space, your highest-risk vendor, or simply a company whose strategy you admire.</p>
        <p>This isn't old school ‘competitive analysis’. These internet-native strategy skills work for identifying opportunities to increase your <strong>own company's</strong> performance, evaluating <strong>partnership opportunities</strong>, researching <strong>prospects</strong> before sales calls, preparing for <strong>customer interviews</strong>, analysing <strong>any player</strong> in your market, and investigating <strong>any digital trend</strong> you're curious about.</p>
        <p>It works even if you've never heard of SimilarWeb, don't know what a UTM parameter is, and think "organic traffic" just means the line at the farmers market.</p>
        <p>It's entirely self-paced (complete it in a weekend or spread it across 5 weeknight evenings), requires zero coding, and you get lifetime access to revisit whenever you rotate into a new focus area.</p>
        <p>Plus, you'll receive four battle-tested bonuses including the <strong>5-Day Quick Win Playbook</strong> that guarantees you'll deliver your first data-backed insight by Friday.</p>
        <p>But first, let me tell you why I built this...</p>

    <section class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <hr />
        <p>My name's Tom Alder.</p>
        <p>I spent 3 years in tech strategy consulting working with companies like PayPal and Afterpay, then ran strategy for DevOps products at Atlassian, and now I’m building Strategy Breakdowns - one of the largest strategy publications in the world (100k+ reading our weekly case studies!)</p>
        <p>Over the years, I've analysed hundreds of companies. And I discovered something that changed everything.</p>
        <h3>The Problem I Kept Seeing</h3>
        <p>When I started in strategy, I struggled with the same problem you probably face right now.</p>
        <p>I'd be in a meeting and someone would ask: "What's this competitor doing differently?", or "Should we prioritise this channel?"</p>
        <p>And I'd... guess. Or worse, I'd say "I'll look into that" and spend the next 4 hours manually clicking through a company’s website, reading blog posts, and compiling vague observations like "They seem super active on social" or "This website looks conversion-focussed."</p>
        <p>When I presented my findings, stakeholders would nod politely but clearly wanted more. More data. More specifics. More confidence.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, there was always someone, let's call him Jacob, who'd casually share his findings:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Actually, Competitor X gets 450K monthly visits, up 32% quarter-over-quarter, with 61% from organic social, 18% from paid social (primarily LinkedIn), 8% from direct, 6% from referrals.</li>
          <li>But -here’s the thing, they just launched a new lead magnet <code>/free-templates</code> that drove 21K visits from this YouTube campaign - their UTM parameters (<code>utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_campaign=pm_template_launch</code>) show their expanding their targeting to product managers, not just devs.</li>
          <li>Their page architecture reveals even broader strategic priorities: Their <code>/enterprise</code> subfolder traffic grew 215% YoY while <code>/startups</code> remained flat MoM - clear upmarket shift</li>
          <li>They're bidding on OUR brand name in paid search (spending est. $3,200/month based on CPC data)</li>
          <li>And they recently added Segment and Mixpanel to their tech stack, signalling a major customer data infrastructure buildout powering these initiatives.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Everyone in the room would lean forward and smile at each other.</p>
        <p>And I'd think: <strong>"Where the hell did he get that data?"</strong></p>
        <h3>The Attempts That Failed</h3>
        <p>I tried everything to close this gap...</p>
        <p>I bought strategy books, but they were too theoretical - abstract concepts with no practical application.</p>
        <p>I watched YouTube videos on ‘competitor analysis’ and ‘strategy frameworks’, but they were generic and basic - nothing I could actually use.</p>
        <p>I looked into research tools but didn't know which to use, how to extract useful insights, or whether I needed to pay for them before getting real value.</p>
        <p>And the frustration kept building because I knew this skill gap was <strong>costing me.</strong></p>
        <p>My ideas got tabled because "we need more data first."</p>
        <p>Strategic projects went to colleagues who could back their ideas with numbers.</p>
        <p>I was seen as a "contributor" - good at execution, but not strategic enough for the next level.</p>
        <h3>The Breaking Point</h3>
        <p>During my annual review, my manager said: "You're great at execution. You're a killer in PowerPoint. But you need to think more strategically to get promoted."</p>
        <p>I realised: if I didn't fix this now, I'd watch another year go by. Another promotion cycle. Another colleague moving up whilst I stayed stuck.</p>
        <p>That's when I decided to build my own system.</p>
        <h3>How I Found the Solution</h3>
        <p>I started systematically researching every tool and tactic available for analysing websites and traffic.</p>
        <p>Not the expensive enterprise software or ‘industry reports’ that costs thousands per month - but the free tools, browser extensions, and overlooked data sources that anyone with an internet connection can access (if you know where to look).</p>
        <p>I tested everything. Semrush. Ubersuggest. Wappalyzer. Built-in browser tools. UTM parameters. Backlink maps. Domain architecture analysers.</p>
        <p>I documented exactly what added value to me at work, versus those that led to nothing useful. Which tools gave accurate data. Which tactics actually generated insights I could present with confidence. Which techniques took 2 minutes versus 2 days.</p>
        <p>And then I used this system every single day in my work.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, I was the one presenting traffic breakdowns in meetings. I was identifying customer needs based on search data. I was spotting tech stack changes that signalled strategic shifts.</p>
        <p>My recommendations stopped getting questioned. They got implemented.</p>
        <h3>Turning It Into a System</h3>
        <p>Over time, other strategists started asking: "How did you find that?" and "Can you show me how to do this?"</p>
        <p>So I packaged everything into a structured video course called <strong>StrategyHub</strong> the exact system I wish I'd had when I was struggling.</p>
        <p>I shared it with beta testers: product managers at Google, strategy consultants at McKinsey, hungry operators at early-stage startups.</p>
        <p>The feedback was overwhelming.</p>
        <p>And now, for the first time, I'm making the foundational module <strong>Websites &amp; Traffic</strong> available as a standalone offer.</p>

        <h3>Introducing: Websites &amp; Traffic</h3>
        <p><em>Core</em> <em>Module 1 of StrategyHub</em></p>
        <p>A complete video training system that teaches you 28 specific tactical skills for analysing any company's digital footprint - so you can walk into any strategic meeting with bulletproof data instead of educated guesses.</p>
        <h3>What Makes This Different</h3>
        <p>This is the <strong>only</strong> strategy training that shows you exactly where to click, which tools to use, and how to extract insights in real-time - no theory, just screen shares with step-by-step walkthroughs.</p>
        <p>In ~<strong>2.5 hours of focused training</strong> (complete it in a weekend or across a few weeknights), you'll go from struggling to research competitors to confidently presenting ideas that makes your whole team nod approvingly.</p>
        <p>It doesn't matter if you're in product, marketing, strategy, operations, consulting, or running the whole ship. These skills work across every strategic role because they're built on accessing data that's universally useful.</p>
        <p>And you don't need to be technical. Everything is no-code, beginner-friendly, and demonstrated in screen shares so you can follow along as I show you exactly what to do.</p>
        <p><strong>Real example:</strong> Ben Wilson, a Director at a consulting firm, was looking for creative ways to win new advisory clients. He's smart, ambitious, and hardworking, but in a brutally competitive market where everyone's fighting for the same deals.</p>
        <p>Then he joined StrategyHub.</p>
        <p>The very next day, Ben used one of the research tactics from the <strong>Websites &amp; Traffic</strong> module to impress his prospects with intimate knowledge about their business - including several overlooked strategic opportunities they hadn't spotted themselves.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>✅ Client leadership noticed</li>
          <li>✅ Ben's firm won the pitch</li>
          <li>✅ Ben used the same tactic to win multiple subsequent pitches</li>
          <li>✅ Ben got the recognition, and influence, he deserved.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>(Testimonial images referenced in the copy can be added here.)</em></p>
        <p><strong>The takeaway?</strong> Ben followed a proven system for generating strategic insights instead of guessing his way through client problems. And you can too.</p>

        <h3>Here's What This Is Worth</h3>
        <p>The full StrategyHub course includes 5 complete modules plus 9 bonuses and sells for $900.</p>
        <p>And honestly, that's a bargain when you consider:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A single 2-hour coaching session with a decent strategic coach costs $500-$2,000</li>
          <li>A full-day workshop on competitor analysis would run you at least $2,500-$5,000</li>
          <li>A 10% pay raise for a mid-career tech professional is worth $8,000-$20,000 annually</li>
          <li>A single insight driving a humble 1% bump to your company’s bottom-line is worth… well… a significant amount (now imagine dozens of bumps, all worth more than 1%!)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But here's what makes this offer special:</p>
        <p><strong>You're getting 2 complete modules plus 4 of those 9 bonuses for just $250.</strong></p>
        <p>That's less than a third of the full course price (72% off!). Less than one consulting session. Less than the cost of going to a conference where you collect business cards and yawn through the forgettable talks. Way less than the salary you'll miss out on by delaying your next growth spike or promotion by a single extra month.</p>
        <p>I'm pricing it this way for three reasons:</p>
        <p><strong>First</strong>, because I want to make this accessible to mid-level professionals who have L&amp;D budgets that might cover a $900 purchase, but they want a taste of fast results first.</p>
        <p><strong>Second</strong>, because I genuinely believe that once you experience the value within these modules, you'll want to invest in the full StrategyHub program.</p>
        <p><strong>Third</strong>, because this is the first time I'm doing anything like this, offering a standalone module, and I want to create an entry point that removes all hesitation.</p>
        <p>And think about it this way - <strong>$250 is less than:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>You’ve paid for that SaaS subscription you signed up for last year but never finished onboarding</li>
          <li>One day of the salary difference between your current role and the promotion you're missing out on</li>
          <li>One day of missed revenue when your idea gets tabled because you didn't have the data to act with conviction</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Those expenses fade away - these skills compounds for the rest of your career.</p>
        <p>The question isn't whether you can afford it.</p>
        <p>It's whether you can afford to <em>not</em> take action.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Understanding <strong>your own company's</strong> performance and digital footprint</li>
          <li>Evaluating <strong>potential customers</strong> before sales calls</li>
          <li>Researching <strong>partnership opportunities</strong> and assessing traffic/engagement quality</li>
          <li>Analysing the <strong>market leader</strong> in your space to understand best practices</li>
          <li>Investigating <strong>vendors</strong> or companies you're considering working with</li>
          <li>Researching <strong>any company</strong> whose strategy you find interesting or want to learn from</li>
          <li>Understanding <strong>industry trends</strong> by analysing multiple players</li>
          <li>Preparing for <strong>investor meetings</strong> or <strong>board presentations</strong> with concrete data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These aren't "competitor analysis tools" - they're <strong>digital intelligence tools</strong> that work for any strategic purpose.</p>
        <h3>Is this just for marketers and SEO specialists?</h3>
        <p><strong>Absolutely not.</strong> This is for anyone in a strategic role who needs to back their recommendations with data.</p>
        <p>Product managers use this to understand market gaps and feature priorities. Strategy consultants use this to build client deliverables. Ops leaders use this to evaluate partnership opportunities. Engineers use this to understand growth mechanics. Sales teams use this to research prospects.</p>
        <p>The skills are universal because website traffic data reveals strategic decisions across every function: product priorities, marketing channels, partnership strategies, tech infrastructure, and more.</p>
        <h3>I've never used these types of tools or analysed website traffic before. Will this work for me?</h3>
        <p><strong>Yes - that's exactly who this is built for.</strong></p>
        <p>I assume zero prior knowledge. Every tutorial includes a screen share where I show you exactly where to click, which menus to use, and how to interpret the data.</p>
        <p>There's no coding involved. The tools are designed for product managers, consultants, operators, etc. not just technical engineers.</p>
        <h3>Do the tools in the tutorials cost money?</h3>
        <p>Everything I teach and demo uses only free tools, free plans, or free trials.</p>
        <p>This was a critical design decision that has shaped all corners of the program curriculum.</p>
        <p>Plus, I include a mini playbook in the Introduction module for signing up to tools strategically (using temporary email addresses) so you never get caught by accidental subscriptions.</p>
        <p>You won't need to pay for any tools to complete the training and get results.</p>
        <h3>How long will it take me to see results?</h3>
        <p>If you follow the 5-Day Quick Win Playbook (included as a bonus), you'll deliver your first data-backed insight to your team <strong>within 5 days</strong> of starting.</p>
        <p>The core video content takes approximately 2.5-3 hours total to complete - easily done in a single weekend (or across a few weeknights).</p>
        <p>But because you get <strong>lifetime access</strong>, you can also choose to spread it across a few weeks, take breaks, or revisit sections whenever you need a refresher.</p>
        <h3>How is this different from other strategy books, courses, or YouTube tutorials?</h3>
        <p>When most people think of strategy, they too often jump straight to frameworks, concepts, and theory.</p>
        <p>High-level strategy work (e.g. <em>"What space should we play in?"</em>) that people idolise and want to write memos for is fascinating and important, but there’s simply not that much of it to go around. <strong>The practical reality of strategic work is the thousands of smaller decisions that compound</strong>, and it is the speed and accuracy of those small decisions that actually determines success.</p>
        <p>99.9% of strategic decisions look less like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>“What industry / geography / vertical / customer should we go after?”</em> (ie questions that generally have fixed pre-existing answers)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>and more like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>“What can we learn from the most common question our ICP asked about on Reddit last month?”</em>, or</li>
          <li><em>“How should we decide which pricing tier this feature should fall under?”</em>, or</li>
          <li><em>“What is the highest performing Google Ad our competitor is running, how much daily traffic is it driving, and how should we respond?”</em>, or</li>
          <li><em>“Which [tool / vendor / partner] should we leverage for [XYZ use case], given our [ABC specific requirements]?”</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Being great at these decisions is a fundamentally different skillset to being a great ‘armchair strategist’.</p>
        <p><strong>You need to develop excellent insight generation</strong> - a machine that takes in questions → outputs relevant data → followed by strong hypotheses.</p>
        <p>This is what companies need, and this is what StrategyHub teaches. All modules (including Websites &amp; Traffic) are designed in the following way:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Practical skills:</strong> This course gives you practical skills to tangibly increase your ability to drive real impact each day, without wasting time teaching you abstract theory you won’t actually use. Most strategy education is stuck in the pre-internet era of abstract models and theoretical frameworks. This is built specifically for the modern age where data is freely available.</li>
          <li><strong>Methodology:</strong> Each tutorial follows a proven interactive learning methodology that helps you learn and apply a specific tool, tactic, or technique you can use immediately at work. Every tutorial is a screen share where you watch me actually perform the tactics in real-time. No theory. Just practical walkthroughs you can replicate immediately.</li>
          <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Our goal with this course is to save you years of trial and error trying to stitch together your own insight generation system. It's meant for busy strategists who want results and decisions, not just more conceptual learning.</li>
          <li><strong>Career-oriented:</strong> StrategyHub is designed to progress your career, whether that be getting a promotion / raise / job offer, or launching / growing your own business. It comes with a library of bonuses that help you apply what you've learnt to your current projects, showcase your value to your peers, and ultimately level up at work.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Why start with Websites &amp; Traffic instead of another module?</h3>
        <p>Because <strong>every company has a website, and every company is playing the traffic game.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Just about every major strategic decision traces back to traffic.</strong></p>
        <p>Whether you're in product, marketing, sales, operations, or strategy - understanding where traffic comes from, how customers/users engage, and what drives growth is fundamental to every strategic decision inside internet-era companies.</p>
        <p>When you're evaluating a partnership - you need to know their customer quality and traffic sources.</p>
        <p>When you're analysing a competitor - you need to see where their growth is actually coming from.</p>
        <p>When you're recommending a new channel - you need data on what's working in your market.</p>
        <p>When you're presenting to stakeholders - you need concrete numbers, not educated guesses.</p>
        <p>Here's what most people miss: websites and traffic data isn't just for marketers. It's the foundational layer of intelligence that makes <em>every</em> strategic role more effective.</p>
        <p>This is the foundational skillset that unlocks everything else. Once you master analysing digital footprints, the other modules (Companies &amp; Products, Markets &amp; Trends, People &amp; Socials) become significantly more valuable because you have the core analytical foundation.</p>
        <h3>I'm worried I won't have time to complete it. What if I buy it and never use it?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You have <strong>lifetime access</strong> to the course materials.</li>
          <li>You have lifetime access to <strong>future updates for free</strong>.</li>
          <li>You can go through the course <strong>whenever you want</strong>.</li>
          <li>You can <strong>progress at your own pace</strong> through the lessons.</li>
          <li>You can review any part of the course <strong>long after you finish</strong>. The course content has been designed to facilitate going back to lessons as you need them, and apply the learnings as efficiently as possible to whatever you're currently focussed on at work.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So even if you don't have time today, because you have a lot going on right now, you can invest in Websites &amp; Traffic now and start whenever you prefer.</p>
        <p>So even if you're slammed this month, you can start it next quarter when things calm down.</p>
        <p>Plus, remember our unbeatable <strong>"First 30 Days" Promise</strong>: if you go through the material within 30 days and don't find it valuable, just email us for a full refund.</p>
        <p>Lastly, this program includes the bonus 5-Day Quick Win Playbook, which is designed specifically for time-poor professionals. You can generate your first insight in less than a week, even with a full-time job.</p>
        <h3>Does this work for my industry / company / role?</h3>
        <p><strong>Yes - the tactics inside this program are universal. They are</strong> especially useful if you work in tech or any tech-adjacent business (consulting, advertising, finance, media, etc).</p>
        <p>The core principles and techniques apply universally because every company has a website, traffic sources, and digital footprint to analyse.</p>
        <p>Sure, your niche might have its quirks. But focusing only on your direct competitors or one industry is actually a common mistake - you end up at a local optimum.</p>
        <p>Real strategic breakthroughs come from looking at adjacent industries, understanding underlying patterns, and adapting tactics to your context.</p>
        <p>That's where asymmetric opportunities hide, and that’s why the curriculum has been designed the way it is.</p>
        <h3>What if I'm more senior / junior than your target audience?</h3>
        <p>The training works across experience levels:</p>
        <p><strong>If you're more junior</strong> (1-3 years experience): You'll accelerate your learning curve by 2-3 years and position yourself as "the person who brings data" in meetings—a massive competitive advantage for early-career professionals.</p>
        <p><strong>If you're more senior</strong> (VP+ level): You'll have a structured system to delegate to your team, ensure consistency in analysis quality, and quickly audit companies yourself when making high-stakes decisions.</p>
        <p>The core skills remain valuable at every career stage.</p>
        <h3>Can I expense this through my company's L&amp;D budget?</h3>
        <p><strong>Yes - many students do exactly that.</strong></p>
        <p>This training directly improves your performance at work by helping you make better strategic recommendations backed by data.</p>
        <p>If you need help making the case to your manager, I've prepared a <a href="https://www.notion.so/114a1965bd7780f58b09f6c20b60e631?pvs=21">template email you can use here.</a></p>
