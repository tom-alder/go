          <h3>If you're running an <span style="background-color: #eef0ff; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 4px;">online business</span> and you've ever looked at a competitor and thought: <em style="color: #000;">"How are they growing like that?"</em></h3>
          <p>Then found yourself clicking through their website, reading tweets, and piecing together guesses … without any real numbers to tell you which moves are actually driving results.</p>
          <p><strong>→ I'm about to show you how to become the founder who always has the data.</strong></p>
          
        <p>In just 5 days, you'll master <span style="background-color: #eef0ff; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 4px;">28 specific tactical skills that let you reverse-engineer any company's digital strategy</span> - whether that's your #1 competitor, a potential customer you want to win, the market leader in your space, your highest-risk vendor, or simply a company whose strategy you admire.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em; background-color: #eef0ff; padding: 16px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 24px 0;"><strong>This isn't old school 'competitive analysis'.</strong></p>
        
        <p>These internet-native strategy skills work for increasing your <strong>own company's</strong> performance, evaluating <strong>partnership opportunities</strong>, researching <strong>prospects</strong> before sales calls, preparing for <strong>customer interviews</strong>, analysing <strong>any player</strong> in your market, or investigating <strong>any digital trend</strong> you're curious about.</p>
        <p>It works even if you've never heard of SimilarWeb, don't know what a UTM parameter is, and think "organic traffic" just means the line at the farmers market.</p>
        <p>It's entirely self-paced (complete it in a weekend or spread it across 5 weeknights), requires zero coding, and you get lifetime access to revisit whenever you rotate into a new focus area.</p>
        <p>Plus, you'll receive <span style="background-color: #eef0ff; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 4px;">eight battle-tested bonuses</span>, including the <strong>5-Day Quick Win Playbook</strong>, designed to ensure you uncover at least one concrete growth insight you can act on immediately.</p>

        <h3>The Problem I Kept Seeing</h3>
        <p>When I started working in strategy, I kept running into a problem that looks very familiar if you're <span style="background-color: #eef0ff; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 4px;">running an online business</span>.</p>
        <p>I'd be deep in a project and someone would ask:<br>
        <em>"Why is this competitor pulling away?"</em> or<br>
        <em>"Should we double down on this channel - or is it just a distraction?"</em></p>
        <p>And I'd… <strong>guess</strong>.</p>
        <p>Or worse, I'd say <em>"I'll dig into it"</em>, then spend the next few hours clicking through a company's website, skimming blog posts, scanning feeds, and pulling together vague observations like:<br>
        <em>"They seem very active on LinkedIn"</em> or<br>
        <em>"This site feels conversion-focused."</em></p>
        <p>When I shared my thinking, it sounded reasonable.<br>
        But it wasn't convincing.</p>
        <p>What was missing was obvious.</p>
        <p>More confidence.<br>
        More specificity.<br>
        <strong>More data.</strong></p>
        <p>Meanwhile, there was always someone else - let's call him Jacob - who'd calmly lay out the real picture:</p>
        <div style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #9ca3af; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 8px;">
          <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;">
            <li style="margin: 12px 0; padding-left: 20px; position: relative;">
              <span style="position: absolute; left: 0; color: #5b5cf6; font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">•</span>
              <strong>Actually, Competitor X gets 450K monthly visits</strong>, up 32% quarter-over-quarter, with 61% from organic social, 18% from paid social (primarily LinkedIn), 8% from direct, 6% from referrals.
            </li>
            <li style="margin: 12px 0; padding-left: 20px; position: relative;">
              <span style="position: absolute; left: 0; color: #5b5cf6; font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">•</span>
                <strong>But here's the thing, they just launched a new lead magnet</strong> <code>/roi-calculator</code> that drove 21K visits from *this* YouTube video - their UTM parameters (<code style="word-break: break-all;">utm_source=youtube&utm_campaign=q4_enterprise_push&utm_content=vp_sales_calculator</code>) show they're targeting VP-level buyers with ROI-focused content to expand into enterprise customers. 
            </li>
            <li style="margin: 12px 0; padding-left: 20px; position: relative;">
              <span style="position: absolute; left: 0; color: #5b5cf6; font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">•</span>
              <strong>Their page architecture reveals the extent of this shift:</strong> Their <code>/enterprise</code> subfolder traffic grew 215% QoQ while <code>/startups</code> remained flat - the uptick is significant and it's clearly their priority right now.
            </li>
            <li style="margin: 12px 0; padding-left: 20px; position: relative;">
              <span style="position: absolute; left: 0; color: #5b5cf6; font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">•</span>
              <strong>They're bidding on OUR brand name</strong> in paid search (spending est. $3,200/month, *here* are their highest-performing ads)
            </li>
            <li style="margin: 12px 0; padding-left: 20px; position: relative;">
              <span style="position: absolute; left: 0; color: #5b5cf6; font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">•</span>
              <strong>And they recently added Segment and Mixpanel</strong> to their tech stack, signalling a major customer data infrastructure buildout powering these ICP expansions.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Everyone in the room would lean forward and smile at each other.</p>
        <p>And I'd think: <strong><em>"Where the hell did he get that data?"</em></strong></p>
        <h3>The Attempts That Failed</h3>
        <p>I tried everything to close this gap...</p>
        <p><strong>I bought strategy books</strong>, but they were too theoretical - abstract concepts with no practical application for <span style="background-color: #eef0ff; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 4px;">internet-native strategy</span>.</p>
        <p><strong>I watched YouTube videos</strong> on 'competitor analysis' and 'strategy frameworks', but they were generic and basic - very little I could actually use to <em>decide what to do next</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>I experimented with research tools</strong>, but quickly got stuck. I didn't know which ones mattered, which metrics were signal vs noise, or how to extract insights without falling into expensive subscriptions or endless dashboards.</p>
        <p>And the frustration kept building, because I could feel the cost.</p>
        <p>Ideas stalled because I couldn't confidently prove they were worth backing.<br>
        Decisions dragged because <em>"we need more data"</em> became a default excuse.<br>
        Time was burned chasing tactics that felt right but didn't move the needle.</p>
        <p><strong>→ I couldn't help but feel like I was guessing my way through everything.</strong></p>
        <h3>The Breaking Point</h3>
        <p>I realised the pattern wasn't going away on its own.</p>
        <p>If I didn't fix this, I'd keep circling the same questions:</p>
        <p>Which option should actually get more investment?<br>
        Is this competitor genuinely outperforming us, or just louder?<br>
        Are we missing something obvious in how the market is moving?</p>
        <p>Another quarter would pass.<br>
        Another set of half-confident decisions.<br>
        Another missed opportunity hiding in plain sight.</p>
        <p>That's when I decided to stop consuming more theoretical advice - and build my own data-driven decision system instead.</p>
        <h3>How I Figured Out a Solution</h3>
        <p>I started systematically researching <span style="background-color: #eef0ff; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 4px;">every tool and tactic available for analysing websites and traffic.</span></p>
        <p>Not the expensive enterprise software or 'industry reports' that costs $1000's per month - but the <strong>free tools, browser extensions, and overlooked data sources</strong> that anyone with an internet connection can access (if you know where to look).</p>
        <p>I tested everything. Semrush. Ubersuggest. Wappalyzer. Built-in browser tools. UTM parameters. Backlink maps. Domain architecture analysers.</p>
        <p><span style="background-color: #eef0ff; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 4px;">I documented exactly what added value to me at work</span>, versus those that led to nothing useful. Which dashboards produced signal vs noise.
          Which tactics surfaced insights we could act on immediately.
          Which techniques took 2 minutes versus 2 days.</p>
        <p>And then I used this <strong>X-ray vision system</strong> on real strategic decisions and projects, over and over again.</p>
        <p>Gradually, something changed.</p>
        <p>I could see where competitors' growth was really coming from. I could spot tech stack changes that signalled strategic shifts before they were announced. I could identify hyper-specific customer intent based on what people were actively searching for and clicking on.</p>
        <p>And most importantly, once the data became clear, the next move usually was too.</p>
        <h3>Turning It Into a System</h3>
        <p>Over time, people kept asking the same questions:<br>
        <em>"How did you find that?"</em> and <em>"Can you show me how you're seeing this?"</em></p>

        <p>I packaged everything into a structured video training called <strong>StrategyHub</strong> - the exact decision framework I wish I'd had when I was still guessing my way through things.</p>
        <p>I built it in close collaboration with a small group of beta users: founders and operators at internet businesses, product managers at Google, strategy consultants at McKinsey, growth leads inside fast-moving startups, solopreneurs, creators.</p>
        <img src="../assets/discovery-feedback.png" alt="Beta tester feedback" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 20px 0;" />
        <p><strong>The feedback was overwhelming.</strong></p>
        <p>People were using the system to uncover growth insights they'd never been able to see before - and, more importantly, to act on them with confidence.</p>
        <p>It quickly became our flagship product, with 150+ founders and operators now using the system to:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 16px 0;">
          <li style="margin: 8px 0; position: relative; padding-left: 20px;"><span style="position: absolute; left: 0; color: #B19EF8; font-weight: bold;">•</span>Make faster, higher-confidence growth decisions</li>
          <li style="margin: 8px 0; position: relative; padding-left: 20px;"><span style="position: absolute; left: 0; color: #B19EF8; font-weight: bold;">•</span>Validate big bets before committing resources</li>

          <h3>What Makes This Different</h3>
        <p>This is the <strong>only</strong> strategy training that shows you <span style="background-color: #eef0ff; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 4px;">exactly where to click, which tools to use, and how to extract insights in real-time</span> - no theory, just screen shares with step-by-step walkthroughs.</p>
        <p>In ~<strong>2.5 hours of focused training</strong> (finish it in a weekend or spread it across a few evenings), you'll go from second-guessing your growth ideas to making clear, defensible decisions you can act on with confidence.</p>
        <p>It doesn't matter whether you're focussed on marketing, product, ops, sales - or a CEO with a whole exec team. These skills work because across domains they're built on foundational digital data every internet business generates, regardless of size or stage.</p>
        <p><strong>And you don't need to be technical.</strong> Everything is no-code, beginner-friendly, and demonstrated in screen shares so you can follow along and apply it to your own business immediately.</p>

          <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0;"><strong>Ben Wilson</strong> was looking for creative ways to win new advisory clients. He's smart, ambitious, and hardworking, but in a brutally competitive market where everyone's fighting for the same deals.</p>

          <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0;">The very next day, Ben used one of the research tactics from the <strong>Websites &amp; Traffic</strong> module to impress his prospects with intimate knowledge about their business - including several overlooked, data-backed strategic opportunities they hadn't spotted themselves.</p>

        <h3>Here's What This Is Worth</h3>
        <p>The <strong>full StrategyHub course</strong> includes 6 modules plus 9 bonuses and sells for <strong>$900</strong></p>
        <p>And honestly, that's a bargain when you consider:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
          <li>A single 2-hour coaching session with a decent strategic coach costs <strong>$500-$2,000</strong></li>
          <li>A full-day workshop on strategy development would run you at least <strong>$2,500-$5,000</strong></li>
          <li>A single insight driving a humble 1% bump to your company's bottom-line is worth… well… a <strong>significant amount</strong> (now imagine dozens of bumps, all worth more than 1%!)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But here's what makes this offer special:</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.3em; background-color: #eef0ff; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 24px 0;"><strong><span style="color: #6b7280;">You're getting</span> 3x full StrategyHub modules <span style="color: #6b7280;">plus</span> 4x StrategyHub bonuses <span style="color: #6b7280;">plus</span> 4x exclusive DDGB bonuses <span style="color: #6b7280;">for just</span> <span style="color: #3843EB;">$250</span>.</strong></p>
        <p><span style="background-color: #eef0ff; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 4px;">That's less than a third of the full course price (72% off!)</span>. Less than one consulting session. Less than the cost of going to a conference where you collect business cards and yawn through forgettable talks. Way less than the income you'll lose out on by delaying your next growth spike by a single extra month.</p>
        <p><strong>I'm pricing it this way for three reasons:</strong></p>
        <div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid var(--brand); margin: 16px 0;">
          <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;"><strong style="color: var(--brand);">First</strong>, because founders don't need another big upfront commitment. You want something you can <strong>test quickly, get value from fast</strong>, and decide what to do next with confidence.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;"><strong style="color: var(--brand);">Second</strong>, because I genuinely believe that once you experience the value within these modules, <strong>you'll end up joining the full StrategyHub program too</strong>.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong style="color: var(--brand);">Third</strong>, because this is the first time I'm doing anything like this, offering a standalone bundle, and I want to create a <strong>low-risk, high-upside entry point that removes all hesitation</strong>.</p>
        </div>
        <p>And think about it this way - <strong>$250 is less than:</strong></p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
          <li>One SaaS tool you signed up for, half-used for a month, then quietly cancelled</li>
          <li>A single low-quality experiment that burned time but never shipped</li>
          <li>One bad growth bet you only realised was wrong after months of effort</li>
          <li>One week of delayed revenue because a decision dragged on without enough conviction</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Those costs disappear quickly.<br>
        The downside compounds quietly.</p>
        <p>These skills do the opposite. They compound every time you face a new growth decision.</p>
        <p>The question isn't whether you can afford it.</p>
        <p><span style="background-color: #eef0ff; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 4px;">→ It's whether you can afford to keep guessing.</span></p>

          <button class="faq-question">
            <span>Is this just for competitive analysis?</span>
            <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p><strong>No - and this is important to understand.</strong></p>
            <p>Whilst you absolutely can analyse competitors, these same skills work for understanding any company's digital footprint.</p>
            <p><strong>This includes:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Understanding your own company's performance</li>
              <li>Evaluating potential clients before sales calls</li>
              <li>Researching partnership opportunities</li>
              <li>Analysing market leaders to understand best practices</li>
              <li>Investigating vendors or companies you're considering working with</li>
              <li>Researching investors you're considering raising from</li>
              <li>Reverse-engineering companies in other industries</li>
              <li>Understanding industry trends</li>
              <li>Preparing for board presentations with concrete data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These aren't "competitor analysis tools".<br>
            They're digital intelligence tools that work for any strategic purpose.</p>

          <button class="faq-question">
            <span>Is this just for marketers and SEO specialists?</span>
            <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p><strong>Absolutely not. And that assumption is exactly why many founders miss the value.</strong></p>
            <p>As a founder, you're not "just" one role. You're switching hats constantly.<br>
            This system is built for that reality.</p>
            <p><strong>Founders use it to:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Validate product ideas and spot market gaps</li>
              <li>Evaluate growth channels before spending money</li>
              <li>Research prospects, partners, or acquisition targets</li>
              <li>Understand why competitors are gaining traction</li>
              <li>Make fork-in-the-road decisions with data instead of gut feel</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why does one system work across so many contexts?</strong></p>
            <p>Because every meaningful business decision leaves a digital footprint:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>How customers behave</li>
              <li>Where attention flows</li>
              <li>What channels convert</li>
              <li>Which bets are paying off</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If your business touches the internet (it does), this applies to you.</p>
          </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">
            <span>I've never used these types of tools or analysed website traffic before. Will this work for me?</span>
            <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p><strong>Yes - that's exactly who this is built for.</strong></p>
            <p>I assume zero prior knowledge. Every tutorial includes a screen share showing:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Where to click</li>
              <li>Which menus to use</li>
              <li>How to interpret the data</li>
              <li>How to apply it to real decisions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>No coding. No technical background required.</p>
            <p>If you can find a song on Spotify or check your step count on Apple Health, you can use these tools.</p>
            <p>You also get the 5-Day Quick Win Playbook, which walks you step by step through finding and applying your first high-impact insight.</p>

          <button class="faq-question">

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Everything I teach and demo uses only free tools, free plans, or free trials.</p>
            <p>This was a critical design decision that has shaped all corners of the program curriculum.</p>
            <p>Plus, I include a mini playbook in the Introduction module for signing up to tools strategically (using temporary email addresses) so you never get caught by accidental subscriptions.</p>
            <p>You won't need to pay for any tools to complete the training and get results.</p>

            <p><strong>Fast - if you want it to be.</strong></p>
            <p>If you follow the 5-Day Quick Win Playbook, you'll generate your first data-backed insight and follow-up actions within 5 days.</p>
            <p>The core video content takes approximately 2.5 hours total and can be completed in a weekend or spread across a few evenings.</p>
            <p><strong>Because you get lifetime access, you can:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Apply one technique and come back later</li>
              <li>Revisit modules when a new decision comes up</li>
              <li>Use it as a reference whenever you're evaluating a new idea or channel</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This isn't a "watch once and forget" course.<br>
            It's a system you'll reuse as your business evolves.</p>

          <button class="faq-question">
            <span>How is this different from other strategy books, courses, or YouTube tutorials?</span>
            <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Most strategy education jumps straight to frameworks and theory.</p>
            <p>But 99.9% of real strategic decisions are smaller, compounding decisions like:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Which pricing tier a feature belongs in</li>
              <li>What customers are actually asking about</li>
              <li>Which competitor ads are performing</li>
              <li>Which tool or partner to choose for a specific use case</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Being great at these decisions requires excellent insight generation.</p>
            <p><strong>That's what DDGB teaches:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Practical data-driven skills</li>
              <li>Real-time screen share walkthroughs</li>
              <li>Outcome-oriented design focused on speed, clarity, and action</li>
            </ul>
            <p>DDGB is built for the modern reality where strong decisions are backed by data - not opinions.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">
            <span>Why start with Websites &amp; Traffic instead of another module?</span>
            <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Because almost every meaningful business decision traces back to traffic.</p>
            <p>Every company has a website.<br>
            Every company competes for attention.<br>
            Every company's growth leaves signals in how people arrive, engage, and convert.</p>
            <p>When you're evaluating a partnership - you need to know their customer quality and traffic sources.</p>
            <p>When you're analysing a competitor - you need to see where their growth is actually coming from.</p>
            <p>When you're considering a new channel - you need data on what's working in your market.</p>
            <p>Websites and traffic data aren't just marketing inputs.<br>
            They're the foundational layer of intelligence behind every strategic decision.</p>
            <p>That's why this is the starting point.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">
            <span>I'm worried I won't have time to complete it. What if I buy it and never use it?</span>
            <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>That's fair. Especially as a founder.</p>
            <p>That's exactly why I've designed it like this:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>You have lifetime access to the course materials.</li>
              <li>You have lifetime access to future updates for free.</li>
              <li>You can go through the course whenever you want.</li>
              <li>You can progress at your own pace through the lessons.</li>
              <li>You can review any part of the course long after you finish. The course content has been designed to facilitate going back to lessons as you need them, and apply the learnings as efficiently as possible to whatever you're currently focussed on in your business.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So even if you don't have time today, because you have a lot going on right now, you can invest in Data-Driven Growth Bundle now and start whenever you prefer.</p>
            <p>So even if you're slammed this month, you can start it next quarter when things calm down.</p>
            <p>Plus, remember our unbeatable "First 30 Days" Promise: if you go through the material within 30 days and don't find it valuable, just email us for a full refund.</p>
            <p>Lastly, this program includes the bonus 5-Day Quick Win Playbook, which is designed specifically for time-poor founders. You can generate your first win in less than a week.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p><strong>Yes - the tactics inside this program are universal. They are</strong> especially useful if you work in tech or any tech-adjacent business (consulting, advertising, finance, media, etc).</p>
            <p>The core principles and techniques apply universally because every company has a website, traffic sources, and digital footprint to analyse.</p>
            <p>Sure, your niche might have its quirks. But focusing only on your direct competitors or one industry is actually a common mistake - you end up at a local optimum.</p>
            <p>Real strategic breakthroughs come from looking at adjacent industries, understanding underlying patterns, and adapting tactics to your context.</p>
            <p>That's where asymmetric opportunities hide, and that's why the curriculum has been designed the way it is.</p>
