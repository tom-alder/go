          <h3>If you're working in a <span style="background-color: #eef0ff; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 4px;">strategic role at a digital-first company</span> and you've ever been asked <em style="color: #000;">"How do we grow like that?"</em> in a meeting...</h3>
          <p>Then watched a colleague pull up exact traffic numbers, channel breakdowns, and trend data whilst you scrambled for something concrete to say...</p>
          <p><strong>→ I'm about to show you how to become that person who <em>always has the data</em>.</strong></p>
          
        <p>In just 5 days, you'll master <span style="background-color: #eef0ff; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 4px;">28 specific tactical skills that let you reverse-engineer any company's digital strategy</span> - whether that's your #1 competitor, a potential customer you want to win, the market leader in your space, your highest-risk vendor, or simply a company whose strategy you admire.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em; background-color: #eef0ff; padding: 16px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 24px 0;"><strong>This isn't old school 'competitive analysis'.</strong></p>
        
        <p>These internet-native strategy skills work for increasing your <strong>own company's</strong> performance, evaluating <strong>partnership opportunities</strong>, researching <strong>prospects</strong> before sales calls, preparing for <strong>customer interviews</strong>, analysing <strong>any player</strong> in your market, or investigating <strong>any digital trend</strong> you're curious about.</p>
        <p>It works even if you've never heard of SimilarWeb, don't know what a UTM parameter is, and think "organic traffic" just means the line at the farmers market.</p>
        <p>It's entirely self-paced (complete it in a weekend or spread it across 5 weeknights), requires zero coding, and you get lifetime access to revisit whenever you rotate into a new focus area.</p>
        <p>Plus, you'll receive <span style="background-color: #eef0ff; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 4px;">four battle-tested bonuses</span> including the <strong>5-Day Quick Win Playbook</strong> that guarantees you'll deliver your first data-backed insight by Friday.</p>

        <div class="card" style="margin-top: 48px; background: white;">
        <h3>The Problem I Kept Seeing</h3>
        <p>When I started in strategy, <span style="background-color: #eef0ff; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 4px;">I struggled with the same problem you probably face right now.</span></p>
        <p>I'd be in a meeting and someone would ask: <em>"What's this competitor doing differently?"</em>, or <em>"Should we prioritise this channel?"</em></p>
        <p>And I'd... <strong>guess</strong>. Or worse, I'd say <em>"I'll look into that"</em> and spend the next <strong>4 hours</strong> manually clicking through a company's website, reading blog posts, and compiling vague observations like <em>"They seem super active on social"</em> or <em>"This website looks conversion-focussed."</em></p>
        <p>When I presented my findings, stakeholders would nod politely but clearly wanted more.</p>
        <p>More confidence.<br>
        More specifics.<br>
        <strong>More <strong>data</strong>.</strong></p>
        <p>Meanwhile, there was always someone, let's call him Jacob, who'd casually share his findings:</p>
        <div style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #9ca3af; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 8px;">
          <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;">
            <li style="margin: 12px 0; padding-left: 20px; position: relative;">
              <span style="position: absolute; left: 0; color: #5b5cf6; font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">•</span>
              <strong>Actually, Competitor X gets 450K monthly visits</strong>, up 32% quarter-over-quarter, with 61% from organic social, 18% from paid social (primarily LinkedIn), 8% from direct, 6% from referrals.
            </li>
            <li style="margin: 12px 0; padding-left: 20px; position: relative;">
              <span style="position: absolute; left: 0; color: #5b5cf6; font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">•</span>
                <strong>But here's the thing, they just launched a new lead magnet</strong> <code>/roi-calculator</code> that drove 21K visits from *this* YouTube video - their UTM parameters (<code style="word-break: break-all;">utm_source=youtube&utm_campaign=q4_enterprise_push&utm_content=vp_sales_calculator</code>) show they're targeting VP-level buyers with ROI-focused content to expand into enterprise customers. 
            </li>
            <li style="margin: 12px 0; padding-left: 20px; position: relative;">
              <span style="position: absolute; left: 0; color: #5b5cf6; font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">•</span>
              <strong>Their page architecture reveals the extent of this shift:</strong> Their <code>/enterprise</code> subfolder traffic grew 215% QoQ while <code>/startups</code> remained flat - the uptick is significant and it's clearly their priority right now.
            </li>
            <li style="margin: 12px 0; padding-left: 20px; position: relative;">
              <span style="position: absolute; left: 0; color: #5b5cf6; font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">•</span>
              <strong>They're bidding on OUR brand name</strong> in paid search (spending est. $3,200/month, *here* are their highest-performing ads)
            </li>
            <li style="margin: 12px 0; padding-left: 20px; position: relative;">
              <span style="position: absolute; left: 0; color: #5b5cf6; font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">•</span>
              <strong>And they recently added Segment and Mixpanel</strong> to their tech stack, signalling a major customer data infrastructure buildout powering these ICP expansions.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Everyone in the room would lean forward and smile at each other.</p>
        <p>And I'd think: <strong><em>"Where the hell did he get that data?"</em></strong></p>
        <h3>The Attempts That Failed</h3>
        <p>I tried everything to close this gap...</p>
        <p><strong>I bought strategy books</strong>, but they were too theoretical - abstract concepts with no practical application for <span style="background-color: #eef0ff; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 4px;">internet-native strategy</span>.</p>
        <p><strong>I watched YouTube videos</strong> on 'competitor analysis' and 'strategy frameworks', but they were generic and basic - nothing I could actually use.</p>
        <p><strong>I looked into research tools</strong> but didn't know which to use, how to extract useful insights, or how to get real value from them without paying for a subscription.</p>
        <p>And the frustration kept building because I knew this skill gap was <strong>costing me.</strong></p>
        <p>My ideas got tabled because <em>"we need more data first."</em></p>
        <p>Strategic projects went to colleagues who could back their ideas with numbers.</p>
        <p><strong>→ I was seen as a <em>"contributor"</em> - good at execution, but not strategic enough for the next level.</strong></p>
        <h3>The Breaking Point</h3>
        <p>During my annual review, my manager said: <em>"You're great at execution. You're a killer in PowerPoint. But you need to think more strategically to get promoted."</em></p>
        <p><strong>I realised:</strong> if I didn't fix this now, I'd watch another year go by. Another promotion cycle. Another colleague moving up whilst I stayed stuck.</p>
        <p>That's when I decided to build my own system.</p>
        <h3>How I Figured Out a Solution</h3>
        <p>I started systematically researching <span style="background-color: #eef0ff; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 4px;">every tool and tactic available for analysing websites and traffic.</span></p>
        <p>Not the expensive enterprise software or 'industry reports' that costs $1000's per month - but the <strong>free tools, browser extensions, and overlooked data sources</strong> that anyone with an internet connection can access (if you know where to look).</p>
        <p>I tested everything. Semrush. Ubersuggest. Wappalyzer. Built-in browser tools. UTM parameters. Backlink maps. Domain architecture analysers.</p>
        <p><span style="background-color: #eef0ff; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 4px;">I documented exactly what added value to me at work</span>, versus those that led to nothing useful. Which dashboards gave relevant data. Which tactics actually generated wildly-useful insights I could present with confidence. Which techniques took 2 minutes versus 2 days.</p>
        <p>And then I used this <strong>X-ray vision system</strong> every single day in my work.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, I was the one presenting traffic breakdowns in meetings. I was spotting tech stack changes that signalled strategic shifts. I was identifying hyper-specific customer needs based on questions they were asking and solutions they were actively searching for. </p>
        <p>My recommendations stopped getting questioned, and started getting implemented.</p>
        <h3>Turning It Into a System</h3>
        <p>Over time, other strategists started asking: <em>"How did you find that?"</em> and <em>"Can you show me how to do this?"</em></p>

        <p>So I packaged everything into a structured video course called <strong>StrategyHub</strong> - the exact system I wish I'd had when I was struggling.</p>
        <p>I built it by working closely with a group of beta testers: product managers at Google, strategy consultants at McKinsey, hungry operators at early-stage startups.</p>
        <img src="../assets/discovery-feedback.png" alt="Beta tester feedback" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 20px 0;" />
        <p><strong>The feedback was overwhelming.</strong></p>
        <p>People were using it to generate strategic insights they'd never been able to find before - and it was transforming the way they worked.</p>
        <p>It became our flagship product, with over 150+ strategists using the system daily to lead projects, create company-defining strategies, and land dream promotions / clients / growth opportunities.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em; background-color: #eef0ff; padding: 16px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 24px 0;"><strong>And now, for the first time, I'm making the foundational module <span style="color: #3843EB; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 900;">Websites &amp; Traffic</span> available within a new standalone product: <span style="color: #3843EB; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 900;">Data-Driven Growth Bundle</span>.</strong></p>

        <p>This is the <strong>only</strong> strategy training that shows you <span style="background-color: #eef0ff; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 4px;">exactly where to click, which tools to use, and how to extract insights in real-time</span> - no theory, just screen shares with step-by-step walkthroughs.</p>

          <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0;"><strong>Ben Wilson</strong>, a Director at a consulting firm, was looking for creative ways to win new advisory clients. He's smart, ambitious, and hardworking, but in a brutally competitive market where everyone's fighting for the same deals.</p>
          <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0;"><span style="background-color: white; color: #B19EF8; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 4px; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Then he joined StrategyHub.</strong></span></p>
          <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0;">The very next day, Ben used one of the research tactics from the <strong>Websites &amp; Traffic</strong> module to impress his prospects with intimate knowledge about their business - including several overlooked strategic opportunities they hadn't spotted themselves.</p>
          <ul style="margin: 0 0 16px 20px;">
            <li>Client leadership noticed</li>
            <li>Ben's firm won the client pitch</li>
            <li>The same tactic won multiple subsequent pitches</li>
            <li>Ben got the recognition, and influence, he deserved</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Here's the email he sent me afterwards:</p>

        <h3>Here's What This Is Worth</h3>
        <p>The <strong>full StrategyHub course</strong> includes 6 modules plus 9 bonuses and sells for <strong>$900</strong></p>
        <p>And honestly, that's a bargain when you consider:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
          <li>A single 2-hour coaching session with a decent strategic coach costs <strong>$500-$2,000</strong></li>
          <li>A full-day workshop on strategy development would run you at least <strong>$2,500-$5,000</strong></li>
          <li>A 10% pay raise for a mid-career tech professional is worth <strong>$8,000-$20,000 (annually!)</strong></li>
          <li>A single insight driving a humble 1% bump to your company's bottom-line is worth… well… a <strong>significant amount</strong> (now imagine dozens of bumps, all worth more than 1%!)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But here's what makes this offer special:</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.3em; background-color: #eef0ff; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 24px 0;"><strong><span style="color: #6b7280;">You're getting</span> 3 full StrategyHub modules <span style="color: #6b7280;">plus</span> 4 high-impact bonuses <span style="color: #6b7280;">for just</span> <span style="color: #3843EB;">$250</span>.</strong></p>
        <p><span style="background-color: #eef0ff; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 4px;">That's less than a third of the full course price (72% off!)</span>. Less than one consulting session. Less than the cost of going to a conference where you collect business cards and yawn through forgettable talks. Way less than the income you'll lose out on by delaying your next growth spike or promotion by a single extra month.</p>
        <p><strong>I'm pricing it this way for three reasons:</strong></p>
        <div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid var(--brand); margin: 16px 0;">
          <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;"><strong style="color: var(--brand);">First</strong>, because I want to make this accessible to mid-level professionals who might have L&amp;D budgets that cover a $900 investment, but they <strong>want a taste of fast results first</strong>.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;"><strong style="color: var(--brand);">Second</strong>, because I genuinely believe that once you experience the value within these modules, <strong>you'll end up joining the full StrategyHub program too</strong>.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong style="color: var(--brand);">Third</strong>, because this is the first time I'm doing anything like this, offering a standalone module, and I want to create an <strong>entry point that removes all hesitation</strong>.</p>
        </div>
        <p>And think about it this way - <strong>$250 is less than:</strong></p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
          <li>The fees for that SaaS subscription you signed up for last year but never finished onboarding</li>
          <li>One day of the salary difference between your current role and the promotion you're missing out on</li>
          <li>One day of missed revenue when your idea gets tabled because you didn't have the data to act with conviction</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Those expenses fade away - these skills compounds for the rest of your career.</p>
        <p>The question isn't whether you can afford it.</p>
        <p><span style="background-color: #eef0ff; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 4px;">→ It's whether you can afford to <strong>not</strong> take action.</span></p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p><strong>No - this is much broader.</strong> Whilst you absolutely can analyse competitors, these same skills work for:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Understanding <strong>your own company's</strong> performance and digital footprint</li>
              <li>Evaluating <strong>potential customers</strong> before sales calls</li>
              <li>Researching <strong>partnership opportunities</strong> and assessing traffic/engagement quality</li>
              <li>Analysing the <strong>market leader</strong> in your space to understand best practices</li>
              <li>Investigating <strong>vendors</strong> or companies you're considering working with</li>
              <li>Researching <strong>any company</strong> whose strategy you find interesting or want to learn from</li>
              <li>Understanding <strong>industry trends</strong> by analysing multiple players</li>
              <li>Preparing for <strong>investor meetings</strong> or <strong>board presentations</strong> with concrete data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These aren't "competitor analysis tools" - they're <strong>digital intelligence tools</strong> that work for any strategic purpose.</p>

            <p>When most people think of strategy, they too often jump straight to frameworks, concepts, and theory.</p>
            <p>High-level strategy work (e.g. <em>"What space should we play in?"</em>) that people idolise and want to write memos for is fascinating and important, but there's simply not that much of it to go around. <strong>The practical reality of strategic work is the thousands of smaller decisions that compound</strong>, and it is the speed and accuracy of those small decisions that actually determines success.</p>
            <p>99.9% of strategic decisions look less like:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><em>"What industry / geography / vertical / customer should we go after?"</em> (ie questions that generally have fixed pre-existing answers)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>and more like:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><em>"What can we learn from the most common question our ICP asked about on Reddit last month?"</em>, or</li>
              <li><em>"How should we decide which pricing tier this feature should fall under?"</em>, or</li>
              <li><em>"What is the highest performing Google Ad our competitor is running, how much daily traffic is it driving, and how should we respond?"</em>, or</li>
              <li><em>"Which [tool / vendor / partner] should we leverage for [XYZ use case], given our [ABC specific requirements]?"</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Being great at these decisions is a fundamentally different skillset to being a great 'armchair strategist'.</p>
            <p><strong>You need to develop excellent insight generation</strong> - a machine that takes in questions → outputs relevant data → followed by strong hypotheses.</p>
            <p>This is what companies need, and this is what StrategyHub teaches. All modules (including Websites &amp; Traffic) are designed in the following way:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Practical skills:</strong> This course gives you practical skills to tangibly increase your ability to drive real impact each day, without wasting time teaching you abstract theory you won't actually use. Most strategy education is stuck in the pre-internet era of abstract models and theoretical frameworks. This is built specifically for the modern age where data is freely available.</li>
              <li><strong>Methodology:</strong> Each tutorial follows a proven interactive learning methodology that helps you learn and apply a specific tool, tactic, or technique you can use immediately at work. Every tutorial is a screen share where you watch me actually perform the tactics in real-time. No theory. Just practical walkthroughs you can replicate immediately.</li>
              <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Our goal with this course is to save you years of trial and error trying to stitch together your own insight generation system. It's meant for busy strategists who want results and decisions, not just more conceptual learning.</li>
              <li><strong>Career-oriented:</strong> StrategyHub is designed to progress your career, whether that be getting a promotion / raise / job offer, or launching / growing your own business. It comes with a library of bonuses that help you apply what you've learnt to your current projects, showcase your value to your peers, and ultimately level up at work.</li>

          <button class="faq-question">
            <span>Why start with Websites &amp; Traffic instead of another module?</span>
            <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Because <strong>every company has a website, and every company is playing the traffic game.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Just about every major strategic decision traces back to traffic.</strong></p>
            <p>Whether you're in product, marketing, sales, operations, or strategy - understanding where traffic comes from, how customers/users engage, and what drives growth is fundamental to every strategic decision inside internet-era companies.</p>
            <p>When you're evaluating a partnership - you need to know their customer quality and traffic sources.</p>
            <p>When you're analysing a competitor - you need to see where their growth is actually coming from.</p>
            <p>When you're recommending a new channel - you need data on what's working in your market.</p>
            <p>When you're presenting to stakeholders - you need concrete numbers, not educated guesses.</p>
            <p>Here's what most people miss: websites and traffic data isn't just for marketers. It's the foundational layer of intelligence that makes <em>every</em> strategic role more effective.</p>
            <p>This is the foundational skillset that unlocks everything else. Once you master analysing digital footprints, the other modules (Companies &amp; Products, Markets &amp; Trends, People &amp; Socials) become significantly more valuable because you have the core analytical foundation.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p><strong>Yes - the tactics inside this program are universal. They are</strong> especially useful if you work in tech or any tech-adjacent business (consulting, advertising, finance, media, etc).</p>
            <p>The core principles and techniques apply universally because every company has a website, traffic sources, and digital footprint to analyse.</p>
            <p>Sure, your niche might have its quirks. But focusing only on your direct competitors or one industry is actually a common mistake - you end up at a local optimum.</p>
            <p>Real strategic breakthroughs come from looking at adjacent industries, understanding underlying patterns, and adapting tactics to your context.</p>
            <p>That's where asymmetric opportunities hide, and that's why the curriculum has been designed the way it is.</p>

            <p>The training works across experience levels:</p>
            <p><strong>If you're more junior</strong> (1-3 years experience): You'll accelerate your learning curve by 2-3 years and position yourself as "the person who brings data" in meetings—a massive competitive advantage for early-career professionals.</p>
            <p><strong>If you're more senior</strong> (VP+ level): You'll have a structured system to delegate to your team, ensure consistency in analysis quality, and quickly audit companies yourself when making high-stakes decisions.</p>
